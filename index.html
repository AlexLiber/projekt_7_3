		<h3>Nick Cave</h3>
		<h1>Red Right Hand</h1>
		<p>Take a little walk to the edge of town<br>
		Go across the tracks<br>
		Where the viaduct looms,<br>
		like a bird of doom<br>
		As it shifts and cracks<br>
		Where secrets lie in the border fires,<br>
		in the humming wires,<br>
		Hey man, you know<br>
		you're never coming back,<br>
		Past the square, past the bridge,<br>
		past the mills, past the stacks<br>
		On a gathering storm comes<br>
		a tall handsome man<br>
		In a dusty black coat with<br>
		a red right hand</p>
		<p>He'll wrap you in his arms,<br>
		tell you that you've been a good boy<br>
		He'll rekindle all the dreams<br>
		it took you a lifetime to destroy<br>
		He'll reach deep into the hole,<br>
		heal your shrinking soul,<br>
		but there won't be a single thing<br>
		that you can do<br>
		He's a god, he's a man,<br>
		he's a ghost, he's a guru<br>
		They're whispering his name<br>
		through this disappearing land<br>
		But hidden in his coat<br>
		is a red right hand</p>
